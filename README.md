## Deployment Workflow

This project uses a structured deployment workflow with multiple environments:

### Environments

- **Development** - Connected to the `development` branch - for testing features
- **Production** - Connected to the `main` branch - for live, user-facing deployments

### Branch Structure

- `main` - Production branch, deployed to the live site
- `development` - Development/staging branch, deployed to staging site
- Feature branches - Created from `development` for implementing new features

### Contributing Flow

1. Create a feature branch from `development`
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Implement your changes and commit them
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature X"
   ```

3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request to the `development` branch
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. After code review and approval, merge the PR into `development`
   - This will automatically deploy to the staging environment

5. Test on the staging environment to verify everything works

6. Create a PR from `development` to `main` for production deployment
   - This requires code review approval before merging

7. After approval, merge to `main` to deploy to production

### Environment Variables

Each environment has its own set of environment variables:

- `.env.development` - Used for the development environment
- `.env.production` - Used for the production environment
